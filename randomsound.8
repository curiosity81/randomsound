.TH RANDOMSOUND 8 "August 18, 2007" "Pepperfish"
.SH NAME
randomsound \- ALSA sound card related entropy gathering daemon.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B randomsound [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Using the low order bit of the ADC output of your sound card, 
\fBrandomsound\fP
gathers entropy, debiases it and offers it up to your kernel's random
pool. It can be tweaked to only write into the pool when it drops
below a certain level, and to back off once the pool is full
enough. This build will set your sound card into 16 bit mono unsigned
input at 8KHz.  If your sound card cannot do that then you will need
to change the defines in asoundrunner.c and recompile the package. You
must have set up asound as root on your machine. This can be done with
the asoundconf tool and its set-default-card command.
.PP
You may also need to use the alsamixer to ensure that the sound card
is generating plenty of noise. Set all the gains nice and high, turn on
any boosters you have. If you have a V_REFLVL or similar then consider
tweaking that.
